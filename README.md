DESCRIPTION
===========

Module **Date::Names** provides the full name of months and days of the week for
the numbers 1..12 and 1..7, respectively, primarily for use with
**Perl 6**'s date functions.

Full names of the months and week days are currently available in the
following languages:

  Name | ISO two-letter code | Notes
  ---  | :---:                 | ---
  Dutch   | nl | Lower-case
  English | en | Capitalized
  French  | fr | Lower-case
  German  | de | Capitalized
  Italian | it | Months capitalized, week days in lower-case
  Norwegian (Bokm√•l) | nb | Lower-case
  Russian | ru | Lower-case 
  Spanish | es | Lower-case

LIMITATIONS
===========

Not all languages have a complete set of two- and three-letter
abbreviations, and some require up to four letters for the
official abbreviations.

The following table shows the hash names for the abbreviations
currently available. Hash names with a 2, 3, or 4 appended are
complete abbreviation sets of that length only. 
Hash names with an 'a' appended are sets of abbreviations of mixed length.

Various two-, three-, and mixed-abbreviation hashes are also
available. See the table below for a complete, current list.
